## [Time-travel theories](http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/Time-travel_theories)

There are many different theories for time travel. Steins;Gate uses the black hole theory mostly, by compressing the data of the brain (2.5 Petabytes), to a size sendable by the phonewave.

**Black holes** are one of the most used resources in time-traveling novels, next to wormholes. The Kerr-black hole theory is the result of Roy Kerr's calculations for relativity. A Kerr-black hole is a singularity that possesses mass and angular momentum, but does not possess electrical charge. This hole spins around a central axis and has two event horizons, which contain a ring-formed singularity. Inside each of the two event horizons, time and space are reversed, so in a Kerr-black hole this swapping occurs twice. In theory, it's possible to escape the ring-formed singularity, although not by the same way you entered it, or simply avoiding it. Crossing the singularity would make you end up in a "negative space" (the definition is still unclear). Avoiding it would cause you to go back in time while you are crossing the first event horizon. Here's a Penrose diagram of two time travelers making their way through the black hole. The dark-blue one avoids the singularity and the light blue one crosses it:

**D-mail** Its principle is to generate a Kerr black hole by a telephone microwave oven (temporary name), and then to inject electrons to control gravity so that the ring-shaped singularity is exposed. Sending text messages or compressed memory data to the exposed ring singularities, D-mail and memory jumps become possible.

**CERN** The European Organization for Nuclear Research. CERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research. In 2012, scientists confirmed the detection of the long-sought Higgs boson, also known by its nickname the "God particle," at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator on the planet. This particle helps give mass to all elementary particles that have mass, such as electrons and protons. Elementary particles that do not have mass, such as the photons that make up light, do not get mass from the Higgs boson.
